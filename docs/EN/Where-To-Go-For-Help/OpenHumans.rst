Donate your data for science
========================================
You can help the community by donating your data to research projects! This helps scientists to pay it forward, develop new scientific ideas and broaden the open mind of open source closed loop systems.
AndroidAPS is ready to synchronize your data with `Open Humans <www.openhumans.org>`_, a platform allowing you to upload, connect, and store your personal data – such as genetics, activity and health data. 

You retain full control about what happens to your data and what projects you want to support by giving them access to your data. Depending on the project you have joined, data is evaluated and used by them in different ways and extent.

Setup
========================================
1. Create your account on www.openhumans.org if not already done. You can reuse your existing Google or Facebook accounts if you wish to.
2. Enable the “Open Humans” plugin in the Config Builder.
3. Open its setting using the cog wheel button. You can restrict upload to times when phone uses Wi-Fi and/or is charged. Click “Sign in to Open Humans” and then "Next" in the bottom right corner of the screen.

Sharing Opportunities
========================================
* `OpenAPS Data Commons <https://www.openhumans.org/activity/openaps-data-commons/>`_
  
  The OpenAPS Data Commons was created to enable a simple way to share data sets from the DIYAPS community for research. The data is shared both with traditional researchers who will create traditional research studies, and with groups or individuals from the community who want to review data as part of their own research projects. The OpenAPS Data Commons uses the “Open Humans” platform to enable people to easily upload and share their data from DIYAPS including AndroidAPS, Loop, and OpenAPS. You can get your data into Open Humans via one of three ways: 1) use the AndroidAPS uploader option to get your data into Open Humans; 2) use the Nightscout Data Transfer to get your data into Open Humans; or 3) manually upload data files into Open Humans. Once you've created an account and gotten your data flowing into Open Humans, make sure to also join the OpenAPS Data Commons in order to donate your data for research if you choose.

Terms of Use
========================================
This is an open source tool that will copy your data to `Open Humans <www.openhumans.org>`_. We retain no rights to share your data with third parties without your explicit authorization. The data the project and app receive are identified via a random user ID and will only be securely transmitted to an Open Humans account with your authorization of that process.
You can stop uploading and delete your upload data at any time via `www.openhumans.org <www.openhumans.org>`_. Beware that some projects that receive data may not support this.

Also see `Open Humans Terms of Use <https://www.openhumans.org/terms/>`_.

Data Privacy
========================================
Open Humans takes care of protecting your privacy by assigning a numerical ID to you for each project. This allows projects to recognize but no identify you. The Application ID uploaded by AndroidAPS is similar and only helps administrate the data. More information can be found here:
